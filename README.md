# babel-webpack-package-boilerplate

A boilerplate geared towards building React-focused NPM packages. Supports 
webpack packaging, babel-preset-env transpilation, eslint-based linting, and 
the AVA test runner, pre-configured with JSDOM, Sinon, and Enzyme. 
Intentionally simple and straightforward.

Run:
```bash
npm run test
```
to see the AVA testing infrastructure test a simple React component using
JSDOM, Sinon, and Enzyme.
